DBMS Semester 6 Coursework
Course Instructor: Sir Asif Malik

Academic Focus: Database Management Systems (DBMS)

📌 Project Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive collection of SQL exercises and laboratory tasks developed during my 6th Semester. The project focuses on practical data retrieval, complex filtering logic, and advanced query optimization using MySQL.

🛠️ Key SQL Concepts Covered
Logical Filtering: Mastering AND, OR, and NOT with strategic use of parentheses for operator precedence.

Wildcard Searching: Advanced string pattern matching using LIKE '%pattern%'.

Set Operations: Efficient multi-value filtering using IN and NOT IN clauses.

Case Sensitivity: Practical implementation of case-insensitive searches and BINARY comparisons.

Data Constraints: Filtering records based on salary thresholds, experience levels, and role-specific keywords.

📂 Repository Structure
Table Schemas: SQL scripts to initialize the emp table and database structure.

Weekly Exercises: Categorized queries covering real-world business scenarios (e.g., filtering department heads, analysts, and salary-specific ranges).

Logical Challenges: Solutions to complex requirements involving multiple negative constraints and character-specific filtering.
